# InstagramObjTest

**Total 5 hours of work**

**Features:**

* Create a simple screen with an input form where people can enter username of an Instagram user and see all his posts (grid). After this form was submitted display a feed of all posts from that user. Bonus points: avoid requiring user to sign in with Instagram.
* Add infinite scroll and ability to “pull to refresh”.
* Implement proper error handling and use an animation to indicate that data is being fetched from the server. Make sure that your application never gets stuck in a loading state forever.
* Allow people to tap on a photo and reach a separate screen where you can see this
* particular photo on top and all of the comments for this photo below.
* Add an autocomplete of usernames so you can search for users and a list of suggestions is
* shown.
* On the photo screen add a parallax effect based on device motion 

**Requirements:**

* iOS8+
* Cache what can be cached. Do not cache what should not be cached.
* Lazy load images.
* Implement any design you like, we don’t care as long as it works.
